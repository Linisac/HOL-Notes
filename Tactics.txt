.If a function FUN (with definition FUN_def) is defined via if-then-else and FUN appears in the goal, then rw[FUN_def] strips the if-then-else and adds the corresponding condition as an assumption
.rw[] can reorient equalities to eliminate variables
.cases_on `n = 1` splits the current goal into two subgoals, for true and false, respectively
.EVAL_TAC can be used to EVAL the terms in the conclusion in the current goal
.ARITH_TAC solves arithmetic goals involving integers (and some friends, like naturals)
.Use metis_tac to do first-order resolution and symmetry of equality but not arithmetics
